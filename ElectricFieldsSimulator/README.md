A simple, modular physics simulator written in Grade 12 modelling the forces and behaviour of multiple point charges acting upon one another, with respect to Coulomb's law & Newton's second law of motion.\
PLEASE NOTE: See the .cs files and the \GUI folder for classes. Run the .exe for the compiled simulator, if desired.\
\
The simulator features the ability to add multiple stationary and non-stationary point charges with given charge values, view the forces acting upon each point, and visualize the movement of the non-stationary point charges with respect to Newton's second law. This was not intended to be especially rigorous, and instead was a simple and fun imagination of the laws involved.
