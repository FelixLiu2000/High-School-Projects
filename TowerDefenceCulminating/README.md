Tower defence project created as a partner culminating project with Bosen Qu in Grade 11.\
PLEASE NOTE: See both the .cs files and \GUI folder for classes. Run the .exe for the compiled game if desired.\
These were our first attempts at OOP principles and involved the design of our own physics and UI classes for the game, jumping far beyond Ontario's Grade 11 Computer Science (ICS3U1) curriculum. Image assets were not original.\
The game features three types of towers, a basic projectile-firing gun, a faster projectile-firing gun, and a area-of-effect missle gun. Projectile physics, boundary & collision checking, animations, placement & selection of towers, grid-based map, and a small UI/widget library were all written without external libraries. UML diagram is included. Image assets were not our own.\
Notice that the game only goes up to three rounds with three types of enemies; 'enemy wave' generation was never finished.
