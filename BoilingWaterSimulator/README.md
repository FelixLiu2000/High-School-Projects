Single class simulator, written in Grade 11, that visualizes the elastic collisions and kinetic energy of water molecules imagined as elastic objects that are 'heated' in a boiling pot.\
This program may be a good challenge for students to learn about checking and updating boundaries using a game loop.\
Features an 'IR Display', setting for heat of the pot, ability to add more molecules at will, and information of imagined temperature of highest and lowest molecules.\
The 'water molecules' abide by an imagined form of gravity and simply gain kinetic energy by being accelerated upon touching the bottom of the pot, or colliding elastically with one another. Once they possess enough energy to leave the 'pot' (screen), they are considered 'gas molecules' and are removed from the simulation.\
