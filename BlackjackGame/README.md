A partner project written in Grade 12 with Bosen Qu that was designed to be a modular, fully-functioning Blackjack game played against the dealer and programmed from the ground up.\
PLEASE NOTE: See the .cs files, GUI folder, and Person folder for classes.\
All of the classes required for the game objects and UI widgets were mostly completed, but unfortunately the main game events and other UI elements were not. As a result, the program is not functional, but the code is interesting nonetheless.
