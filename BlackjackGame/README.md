A partner project written in Grade 12 with Bosen Qu that was designed to be a modular, fully-functioning Blackjack game played against the dealer and programmed from the ground up. It also includes a saving and loading of a paused game via a delimited text file.\
PLEASE NOTE: See the .cs files, GUI folder, and Person folder for classes.\
All of the classes required for the game objects, UI related classes, and the save/load IO were mostly completed, but unfortunately the main game events and UI were not. As a result, the program is not functional, but the code is interesting nonetheless.
