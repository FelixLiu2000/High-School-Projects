# High-School-Projects
A collection of my first steps while learning to program in high school, from Grade 11 to 12. 
These C# Windows Forms projects range from simple, single class programs to larger, object-oriented games or applications. 
Mistakes made in the code were preserved and the projects merely reflect the proficiency of my programming skills during that time.
