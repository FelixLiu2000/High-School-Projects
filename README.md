# High-School-Projects
A collection of a few projects written in high school, from Grade 11 to 12. Uploaded to GitHub from local storage in 2019-03.\
These C# Windows Forms projects range from simple, single class programs to larger, object-oriented games or applications.\
NOTE: Mistakes and poor design choices were preserved to reflect their state at the time of my graduation from high school. I may improve or finish some of these projects in the future, but my current priorities lie in developing a new, major side project with my new skills and continuing to pursue my university education.
