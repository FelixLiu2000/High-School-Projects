# High-School-Projects
A collection of a few projects written in high school, from Grade 11 to 12.\
These C# Windows Forms projects range from simple, single class programs to larger, object-oriented games or applications.\
NOTE: Mistakes and poor design choices were preserved to reflect their state at the time of my graduation from high school. I may improve or finish some of these projects in the future, but my currect priority is developing a new, major side project and pursuing my university education.
